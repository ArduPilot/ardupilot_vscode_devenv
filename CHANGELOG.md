All notable changes to the "ardupilot-devenv" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## Versioning Strategy

This extension follows the VS Code recommended pre-release versioning convention:
- Release versions: `major.EVEN_NUMBER.patch` (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.2.0, 1.4.0)
- Pre-release versions: `major.ODD_NUMBER.patch` (e.g., 1.1.0, 1.3.0, 1.5.0)

This ensures that users who opt into pre-releases always get the latest pre-release version,
while users who don't opt into pre-releases get the latest stable release.
